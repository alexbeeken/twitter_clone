== Twits and Giggles

This is an app was created for educational purposes in order to learn more about AJAX and rails.
The assignment was to mimic the function and design of twitter.
Although we learned a lot about AJAX, this website ended up being a fun exercise in using the marquee tag in CSS.

You can see a working version of this silly app [here](https://twitsandgiggles.herokuapp.com/).
